## Hi there 👋
This is the organization containing the six compiler projects from the Compilers course.\s\s
The first project is a simple visitor model practice that'll be applied in later projects.\s\s
The second project is a simple calculator implemented from scratch.\s\s
The last four projects together build a compiler, as specified in the next segment.\s\s

## a LR(1) compiler running on x86 machines. It was separated into 4 parts.

Part 1 - Building a lexer and a parser using Yacc and Lex\
Part 2 - Constructing an abstract syntax tree\
Part 3 - Implementing context sensitive analysis and building a symbol table\
Part 4 - Using the stack machine model to achieve Code generation\
